## Welcome to My Blog!

Hi there! I'm **Kaivalya Dabhadkar**, and this is my digital playground where I share my adventures through the fascinating worlds of mathematics and artificial intelligence.

### My Philosophy: Intuition First!

I've discovered something magical in my learning journey: **intuition comes before rigor**. Too often, academic texts dive straight into formal proofs and definitions, leaving us wondering:

- *"Wait, why did someone think to do it this way?"*
- *"If I were discovering this for the first time, how would I have approached it?"*
- *"What's the story behind this seemingly arbitrary choice?"*

That's exactly what I aim to fix here! I believe the best way to truly understand any concept is to:

1. **Feel it first** - Get an intuitive sense of what's happening
2. **Question everything** - Ask the "why" questions that textbooks often skip
3. **Teach to learn** - Feynman Techniquing my way one at a time :)

### What You'll Find Here

My primary passion lies in **Mathematics** and **Artificial Intelligence**, but I love exploring any topic that sparks curiosity. Think of this blog as a conversation with a friend who's just as excited about understanding the "why" behind the "what."

<!-- === TOPIC LIST: Add new topics here === -->
